## Summary

This is an adaptation that uses sane-scan-pdf but based on existing files.  The idea being that scanning could be done on a low powered device (i.e. a Raspberry Pi) than the scanned data sent to this docker image for processing.  While if it possible to do all the scanning and processing directly on the Pi it is prohibitively slow, even on a Pi 4.
